This is a relatively silly site meant to embrace the regrettable moments that happen in games.  Without anguish, the joy wouldn't feel quite as good.


This site is built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  The theme is the wonderful [hugo-8bits-theme](https://github.com/miguelsimoni/hugo-8bits-theme), made by Miguel Simoni, coming fromthe work done by  [nes-css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/).

The source code for this site is is available [here](https://github.com/zo0o0ot/regrettable-moments-in-gaming-2).
