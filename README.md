# regrettable-moments-in-gaming

This is a website to show off regrettable moments in gaming that I've experienced.  It's a "Whoops" kind of site where you think things are going well, and then they seem to go comically bad. Laugh with the gamer, not at the gamer!

Website can be viewed at https://regrettable-moments-in-gaming.github.io/

The reason that the repo is called regrettable-moments-in-gaming-2 is because there was a regrettable first attempt at a Hugo site, and it didn't end well.
